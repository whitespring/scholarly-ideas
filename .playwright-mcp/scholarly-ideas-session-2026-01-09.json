I want to make sure I understand the foundation of your research interest.\n\nA few clarifying questions:\n\n1. **What's the specific empirical pattern you've observed?** Can you describe what you've actually seen—whether in data, in fieldwork, or in a particular case—that sparked this interest?\n\n2. **What would theory predict?** Based on established frameworks in your area, what should we expect to happen?\n\n3. **Where does the surprise come from?** What makes this pattern unexpected or hard to explain with existing theory?\n\nThese questions help us move toward articulating a genuine puzzle—not just an interesting topic, but a pattern that demands explanation because it contradicts our current theoretical understanding.\n\nTake your time—the most important thing is being specific about what you've observed.",
