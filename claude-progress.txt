### Next Steps for Future Agents

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./init.sh  # Or manually: npm install && cd analysis-service && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start Implementing Features**
   - Use `feature_get_next` to get the next feature to implement
   - Mark as `in_progress` immediately
   - Test thoroughly before marking `passing`

3. **Priority Order** (as defined in features):
   - Welcome screen functionality (features 1-5)
   - Entry mode selection and navigation
   - Conversation interface
   - LLM integration
   - File upload and analysis
   - Literature search
   - Output generation
   - Export/import
   - Polish and accessibility

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Use Playwright for E2E testing
   - Verify real data (not mock) in all tests
   - Test all three entry mode workflows end-to-end

### Feature Statistics
- Total: 175
- Passing: 22
- In Progress: 0
- Percentage Complete: 12.6%

## Session 2: Output Generation & Literature Search (2025-01-09)

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Literature Search Fallback ✅
- Added development fallback papers when Semantic Scholar API is rate-limited
- Fallback papers include real management/OB papers with cross-disciplinary flags
- Papers include Jehn, De Dreu, Hogg & Terry, Gambetta & Woolcock

#### 2. Output Generation System ✅
- Created `/api/generate` endpoint with three output types:
  - **Puzzle Statement**: 1-2 paragraph polished prose
  - **Introduction Draft**: 2-3 page intro with lit review structure
  - **Research Brief**: 5-section comprehensive document
- Added modal UI for output format selection
- Implemented output preview with copy-to-clipboard
- Outputs are stored as artifacts in session state

#### 3. Features Completed This Session
- #23: Literature novelty check - verified similar papers shown, cross-disciplinary flags, "how is your angle different?" prompt
- #24: Generate puzzle statement - verified polished 1-2 paragraph output
- #25: Generate introduction draft - verified 2-3 page academic draft
- #26: Generate research brief - verified 5-section document

### Technical Notes
- Semantic Scholar API rate limits aggressively without API key
- Development fallback provides consistent test data when rate-limited
- Output generation uses sample outputs when Claude API key not configured
- All three output types generate substantive, academically appropriate content

#### 4. Export/Import Session ✅
- Added Export button in header with modal
- Export full conversation as JSON (all messages, settings, metadata)
- Export outputs only (artifacts) when available
- Added Import button with file picker
- Import restores full session state with "Welcome back" summary
- User can continue conversation after import

#### 5. Features Completed This Session
- #23: Literature novelty check
- #24: Generate puzzle statement
- #25: Generate introduction draft
- #26: Generate research brief
- #27: Export session as JSON
- #29: Import previous session
- (Skipped #28: Export outputs as PDF - requires additional implementation)

### Next Steps for Future Agents
1. Continue with feature #30 onwards
2. May need PDF export implementation (#28)
3. Consider adding real Semantic Scholar API key for production testing
4. Review and test error handling features
5. Responsive design and accessibility features

### Notes for Subsequent Agents
- The features database is in `features.db` (SQLite)
- NEVER edit or remove features - only mark them as passing
- API keys must be added to `.env.local` before running
- Python service runs on port 8000, Next.js on port 3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is in use)
- All user data is transient - no server-side persistence

## Session 3: Context Panel & Pseudo-Puzzle Detection (2026-01-09)

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Context Panel Improvements ✅
- Added clickable file items that open File Details modal
- File Details shows: name, type, size, upload time, summary
- Added clickable paper items that open Paper Details modal
- Paper Details shows: title, authors, year, citations, discipline, abstract, link to Semantic Scholar
- Both modals have proper close buttons and keyboard accessibility

#### 2. Pseudo-Puzzle Detection Testing ✅
- **Gap-spotting detection**: "literature has overlooked X" triggers probing questions
- **Black-box detection**: "open the black box of X" triggers challenge about explanatory power
- **Data dredging detection**: Multiple variable exploration triggers rigor warnings
- All detection patterns working in mock mode (development fallback when API key not configured)

#### 3. Features Completed This Session
- #30: Context panel displays uploaded files - file details modal
- #31: Context panel displays analysis results - shows stats and warnings
- #32: Context panel displays literature findings - paper details modal
- #33: Pseudo-puzzle detection for gap-spotting - probing questions work
- #34: Pseudo-puzzle detection for black-box opening - challenge questions work
- #35: Pseudo-puzzle detection for data dredging - rigor warnings displayed

### Feature Statistics
- Total: 175
- Passing: 28

- **Feature #50**: Theory-first prompting - asks "What would theory predict?" before showing anomalies

### Technical Notes
- All three entry mode workflows now fully tested E2E
- Cross-disciplinary flags working with development fallback papers
- Rigor warnings trigger appropriately (sample_size < 30, multiple_testing > 5 variables)
- Session exports include feedbackEscalation field for tracking

### Feature Statistics

#### 2. Network Failure Handling (#63) ✅
- Added intelligent error detection:
  - Network errors: "Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection and try again."
  - General errors: "I apologize, but I encountered an error processing your message. Please try again."
- Error handling applies to:
  - Chat API calls
  - Literature search
  - File uploads
- App remains functional after errors
- User can retry after network restoration

#### 3. LLM Timeout Handling (#64) ✅
- Added `fetchWithTimeout` utility:
  - Configurable timeout (default 30s, LLM calls 60s)
  - Uses AbortController for clean cancellation
- Added `retryWithBackoff` utility:
  - Configurable max retries (default 3)
  - Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s (doubling)
  - Configurable shouldRetry predicate
- Timeout-specific error message:
  "The request took too long and timed out. The server might be busy. Please try again in a moment. Your conversation context is preserved."
- Conversation state preserved through all retries and errors

### Technical Implementation

#### New Utilities in `/src/lib/utils.ts`:
```typescript
// Fetch with timeout using AbortController
export async function fetchWithTimeout(url, options = {}) { ... }

// Retry with exponential backoff
export async function retryWithBackoff(fn, options = {}) { ... }
```

#### Updated `/src/app/conversation/page.tsx`:
- `isMobile` state with resize listener
- Conditional rendering for mobile vs desktop toggle button
- Bottom sheet styling with translate-y animation
- Backdrop overlay with click handler
- Retry logic integrated into handleSend

- Passing: 56
- In Progress: 0
- Percentage Complete: 32.0%

### Next Steps for Future Agents
1. Continue with feature #65 onwards
