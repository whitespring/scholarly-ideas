Interview 1 - Senior Manager:
The team dynamics were challenging at first, but surprisingly, the conflict actually helped us. I didn't expect that disagreements about strategy would lead to better outcomes, but they did. Leadership pushed us hard, and although I thought it would backfire, it motivated the team.

Interview 2 - Team Lead:
Communication breakdown was the biggest issue. However, when we stopped having daily meetings, things actually improved. I never thought less structure would help, but it did. People felt trusted and worked independently.

Interview 3 - Developer:
I noticed something unexpected - the remote team members performed better than in-office staff. This was contrary to what management believed. Despite the distance, they collaborated more effectively. Leadership didn't expect this but eventually acknowledged it.

Interview 4 - HR Representative:
Trust was an issue initially. But surprisingly, after we removed the time-tracking software, productivity went up. I thought people would slack off, but the opposite happened. People didn't need monitoring - they needed autonomy.

Interview 5 - Product Owner:
We assumed the deadline pressure would hurt quality. However, the tight timeline actually focused the team. I was surprised to find that constraints sparked creativity rather than stifling it. The team discovered new approaches they wouldn't have tried otherwise.

Interview 6 - Junior Developer:
The biggest challenge was unclear roles. But ironically, this ambiguity led to people helping each other more. I didn't expect overlap to be beneficial, but team members learned new skills by filling gaps. What seemed like confusion turned into cross-training.

Interview 7 - Engineering Manager:
We expected the merger to decrease morale. In fact, it energized people. They were afraid of change initially, but realized new opportunities emerged. People who were considering leaving actually became more engaged after the transition.

Interview 8 - Customer Success Lead:
The feedback loop we dreaded implementing actually transformed our process. Turns out customers wanted to be involved more than we assumed. The criticism we feared became our best source of product improvements.
