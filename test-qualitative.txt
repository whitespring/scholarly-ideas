Interview 1:
The team dynamics were challenging because of unclear communication. People didn't know their roles, and there was constant friction about deadlines. Leadership seemed disconnected from day-to-day operations.

Interview 2:
Communication breakdown was the biggest issue. Emails went unanswered, and meetings were ineffective. The leadership team didn't provide clear direction, which led to confusion about priorities.

Interview 3:
I noticed a lack of trust between departments. Communication was poor, and people tended to work in silos. Deadlines were frequently missed because of coordination failures.

Interview 4:
The leadership style didn't match what the team needed. There was a disconnect between management expectations and team capabilities. Communication channels were clogged with unnecessary information.

Interview 5:
Trust was a major issue. People didn't feel safe speaking up in meetings. Leadership decisions felt arbitrary, and communication about changes was always last-minute.

Interview 6:
Role clarity was lacking throughout the project. Without clear communication from leadership, team members duplicated work or left tasks undone. This created frustration and missed deadlines.

Interview 7:
The main problem was silos. Departments didn't talk to each other. Communication tools were inadequate, and leadership didn't prioritize cross-functional collaboration.

Interview 8:
Trust and psychological safety were concerns. People were afraid to admit mistakes. Leadership didn't model vulnerability, and communication became defensive rather than constructive.
